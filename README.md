# Cryptocurrency tracker API
**Under construction**
Cryptocurrency tracker API, is basicaly and api that track the currency market changes.
## Project plans
As a first step, we're creating the Restful-Api with JSON responses. to get the cryptocurrency market state. with illimited requests for *free* for 20 cyrptocurrency.
Also we're adding a *premium plan*, for the 80 other cryptocurrencies.
__The work is opensource, so nothing is paied in real__**

Secondly, we're planing to add a front-end UI for this API in a *different repository* using **React.js**. with a realtime update for the market changes, and a highly interactive user interface (*UI*), with a super modern User Experience (*UX*).

## The dependencies used
1. We're using **express** as a main server server. 
2. **mochajs** as a unit testing framework.
3. **body-parser** as a middleware.
4. **JsonWebToken** for premium purposes.
__The list is going to be changed over the time__**
